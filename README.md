## Problems I encountered

During this project, I encountered a few different problems that I was unsure how to handle.
The first issue I encountered was ugly code when creating the item for each book. There is a lot of code that looks very similar.
I wasn't sure how to deal with this code as i could not think of a way to efficiently reduce the code and still have the project work.

Another of the issues I was unsure how to handle was the length of some of the descriptions.
Some of the descriptions that are imported are very long, so I decreases the font size, but still some of the descriptions are very long.
One way to counteract this would be to cut the text off once it reached a certain length, however this makes the descriptions a lot harder to read.
